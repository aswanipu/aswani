## üöÄ Featured Projects
### 1. Decisively
**Tech Stack:** C#, Xamarin.Forms, SQLite, Firebase, ASP.NET Core, SQL

Decisively is a health-focused mobile application designed to help users manage their wellness efficiently.
Whether you're managing personal health routines or coordinating care for others, Decisively ensures you have all the critical information at your fingertips, empowering you to make informed decisions for a healthier life.
During the development of Decisively, I faced the challenge of being the sole developer responsible for the mobile side of the project. This included implementing offline capabilities and creating dynamic UI elements for Decision Tree (DT)  management. Balancing these responsibilities and ensuring a seamless user experience was both challenging and rewarding.

### 2. MPOS
**Tech Stack:** C#, Xamarin.Forms, SQLite, Firebase, ASP.NET Core, SQL.

The MPOS (Mobile Point of Sale) application enables users to sell items via mobile devices. The main challenge I faced was developing an intuitive and responsive user interface (UI) that ensured a smooth and efficient sales experience across various devices.

### 3. LatPay
**Tech Stack:** C#, Xamarin.Forms, Firebase

The Payment Application enables secure transactions by reading card details using NFC technology. The primary challenge was implementing accurate and reliable NFC reading to ensure seamless and secure payment processing. This feature simplifies transactions with a tap, providing a convenient and efficient payment experience.
